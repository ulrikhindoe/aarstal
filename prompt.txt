Application Requirements

Create an application consisting of four files: index.html, quiz.html, script.js, and styles.css.

General Requirements:

The application should have two pages: index.html and quiz.html.

Navigation between the two pages should be possible using links. The navigation must be responsive and work on mobile devices.
For this use the navbar-toggler button and the collapse class for the navigation links.

Use Bootstrap to make the application responsive. Link to these Bootstrap files:
bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap.bundle.min.js


All text displayed to the user must be in Danish.

Page Details:

index.html:
Displays a list of all questions.
For each question, show the correct answer.
Questions should be sorted by the yearForSorting property.

quiz.html:
Displays a quiz with the following functionality:
Presents one question at a time with its options.

When an answer is clicked:
If correct, the background of the answer should turn light green.
If incorrect, the background of the clicked answer should turn light red, and the correct answer should be highlighted with a green background.

All questions should be presented in a randomized order.

The options for each question should also be displayed in a random order.

Keep track of:
The total number of questions answered.
The number of correct answers.
Also show the percentage of correctly answered questions.
Continuously update and display these statistics on the page.

Include a button to show next question. When this quiz is over this button should not be shown. Instead show the text "Quiz er færdig".

Include a button to restart the quiz.

Data:
Embed all data from aarstal-2.json directly into the script.js file.
The JSON structure is as follows:

        "options": [
            {"option": "17 January 1888", "correct": false},

        ],
        "yearForSorting": 1864
    },
    {
        "question": "When did the Danes start resisting the German occupation?",
        "options": [
            {"option": "1945", "correct": false},
